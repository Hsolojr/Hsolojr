## About Me
Hey there! 👨‍💻 I'm Hugo Solorio Jr, and I'm currently embarking on an exciting adventure in the world of software development through the fantastic online bootcamp program with the University of Oregon! 🎓💻

## 🌟 What I'm Learning

## 📚 My Learning Journey
I'll be documenting my progress, projects, and all the cool things I'll be learning in this README. 📝 So, be sure to check in and see what's cooking in my code kitchen! 🍳🍕
